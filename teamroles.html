            <h1>What to think about in crafting a good team.</h1>
            <h2>Play Styles</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first things that is important to consider is, how do you want to play? <br>
                Some of the most common play styles you will find are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyper Offense - Largely ignores defense, sets up fast sweeps and powerful attacks</li>
                    <li>Stall - Complete opposite of Hyper Offense, stall is based around surviability and can win through extended matches of chip damage. 
                        Can be very frustrating to compete against</li>
                    <li>Balance - If Hyper Offense is on one side of a spectrum and Stall is on the other, Balance teams are a medium in between.</li>
                    <li>Trick Room - Trick Room teams are mentioned less than the previous three but can be considered their own catergory.
                        Trick room teams are centered around the move trick room, a move that reverses speed stats.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Hyper Offense</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to roles, doubles are played much differently than singles. There are a lot more pieces to consider and many more ways to set up for a sweep. 
                In most cases, you will send out a "lead" first. The role of the lead is to use set up moves such as "Spikes" which will make any new Pokémon that is swapped in take damage upon entering.
                In another case, a good move would be "Taunt" which prevents the opponents lead from setting up Spikes or any other entry hazard.
                <br> <br>
                The next, most logical role to play would be a "Wallbreaker", responsible for weakening the opponent down using some of the most powerful attacks in their arsenal.
                An example of a good wallbreaker would be Kyurem-white. With a 170 Atk and 120 Sp. Atk stat, it is able to viably use both Physical and Special moves.
                On top of that, it's range of moves that it can use is phenomenal. This makes Kyurem-white a very effective wall breaker.
                <br> <br>
                What is arguably the most important role of Hyper Offense is the sweeper. The sweeper's role is to find a win condition (wincon) and take advantage of it.
                This usually requires help from the previously mentioned roles to set up and after it is set up, the sweeper can easily take down the rest of the remaining Pokémon one by one.
                <br> <br>
                The final role of a well-rounded hyper offense is the Cleaner. Most cleaners will have exceedingly high speed stats and make use of the STAB effect. 
                Their main function is to finish off weakened enemies if the sweepers did not.

            </p>
            <h2>Stall</h2>
            <p>
                The roles in stall teams are much less defined than its counterparts. However, from my experience I have divided them into two main roles.
                <br> <br>
                I am going to dub the first role of stall teams as the "Chipper." Most chippers will have very high defense stats and utilize abilities that make eliminating them very difficult.
                While this is happening, they are using moves such as "stealth rock" which damages Pokémon upon entry to the field based on their susceptability to rock-types.
                A good example of this is the Pokémon "Ferrothorn." Boasting 131 Def and 116 Sp. Def, Ferrothorn can be a difficult Pokémon to kill. On top of its high defense,
                it is also able to have the ability "Iron Barbs" which will damage any Pokémon who attacks it with a physical move. A good counter to a Pokémon like this would be Hatterene.
                Hatterene can have the ability "Magic Bounce" which reflects any and all status moves as well as entry hazard moves such as Spikes or Stealth Rock.
                <br> <br>
                The other role I am going to call the survivor. The survivor, much like the chipper will often have a high defense stat. In doubles especially though, the main role of the survivor is to both keep itself alive as well as its partner.
                A good example of a survivor is Blissey. With a base health stat of 255 HP and 135 Sp. Def, Blissey is able to tank many hits. Its abilities are also quite useful. You could use Serene Grace, which doubles the chance for attacks to inflict a status condition if the attack allows it to.
                It also can use Healer, which gives a chance to simply heal itself or its team of any status condition.
            </p>
            <h2>Balance</h2>
            <p>
                As the name would suggest, balance teams find a medium between a hyper offensive strategy and a stall based battle. 
                <br> <br>
                There is much less to discuss here due to the fact that most balance teams consist of a mixture of what I mentioned above. For example, someone might lead with a Pokémon like Ferrothorn and get something like spikes on the field.
                He then might opt to switch in a more powerful Pokémon like Kyurem. A lot of balance teams are different which makes them very difficult to define.
