            <h2>Moves</h2>
            <p>
                A move is any of the four actions a given Pokémon can use. It is separated into Physical Attacks, Special Attacks, and Status.
                The first two are self-explanitory, but status is any move that doesn't directly inflict damage, but changes something about itself, teamate, opponent, or field.
                <br> <br>
                A move will always have one type assigned to it. This type determines how much it affects the opponent. If for example, you were to use the move Earthquake on a flying type, it would do no damage because flying types are completely immune to ground types.
                However, if you were to use a ground type move on an electric type, it would inflict 2x the normal damage because electric types are weak to ground.
